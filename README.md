# Curriculum Learning
Welcome! One of my current research interests is in optimization for machine learning models, particularly language models. One interesting training heuristic (that is quite intuitive) is called curriculum learning,which is an extension of stochastic gradient descent. This repository
contains my notes on curriculum learning, as well as interesting papers on
the topic and code for my experiments (in PyTorch). Hopefully, I'll keep this repository up to date with my progress!
