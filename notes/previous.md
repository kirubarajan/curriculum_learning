# Previous Work
The core of Curriculum Learning (as it relates to this research project) can be distilled into these four papers, which are arranged in chronological order and increasingly become more focused on natural language processing (my interest was sparked at NAACL in 2019). 

## Curriculum Learning 
> [Bengio et al.] ICML 2009

## Automated Curriculum Learning for Neural Networks 
> [Graves et al.] ICML 2017

## Curriculum Learning by Transfer Learning: Theory and Experiments with Deep Networks 
> [Weinshall et al.] ICML 2018

## Competence-based Curriculum Learning for Neural Machine Translation
> [Platanios et al.] NAACL 2019
